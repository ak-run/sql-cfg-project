# sql-cfg-project
This is a SQL final project of SQL Kickstarter with Code First Girls. We've got 3 weeks to complete it.

# requirements
1. Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 8 tables
3. Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations
4. Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
5. In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
6. Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
7. Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown - first one created

Our DB has 8 tables, all tables are connected with primary and foreign keys and the database is normalised.
The database has 4 views. 
There is a stored function to show if a customer booked an activity (e.g. helpful to upsell to those customers who didn't).
A stored procedure allows to delete a booking from bookings, activities_booked, and rooms_booked tables at once. 
TBC

# extra features which we aim to acheive.
1. In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
2. In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
3. In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs
4. Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
5. Prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis

# The database is for a holiday booking company and it's called holidays
