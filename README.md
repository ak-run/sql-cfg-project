1. Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
2. Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations
3. Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
4. In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
5. Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
6. Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown - first one created

# extra features which we aim to acheive.
✔ In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
✔ In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
✔ In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs
✔ Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
